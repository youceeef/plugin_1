description: Make a "What If" animated episode from one topic line ("What if you could rewind 10 seconds?"), in the dusk-lit stick-figure style of the What If channels that broke out on YouTube in October 2026. Writes the script on the seven-beat What If formula, voices it with ElevenLabs, lays out a shot list at the genre's pace, renders a storyboard of stills and self-checks it before animating, animates every frame in code (Remotion and SVG, with an original cast on one rig, rooms in perspective and light from lamps and windows), generates and syncs the sound, and masters a finished 15-25 s episode to -14 LUFS. Use when someone asks for a What If episode, animation or cartoon, "make a what if video about X", a stick-figure explainer in this style, or to run the free What If skill.

# What If animation

One topic line in, a finished 15-25 second episode out. Every frame is SVG that Claude writes (rendered by
Remotion); the voice and the sound come from ElevenLabs. Two examples ship in `studio/src/episodes/`, both ready to
render: `rewind` ("What if you could rewind 10 seconds?", the proof clip: shots played backwards as the power) and
`copy-paste` ("What if you could copy and paste anything?", the skill's first full run: a new kitchen set, a
schematic for the science beat, a cliffhanger blackout). Read the one closest to your topic before you start.

| File | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `references/formula.md` | The seven-beat What If formula, the 15-25 s shape, script rules, choosing a topic |
| `references/look.md` | The measured look, pace, shot vocabulary, and the storyboard and motion checklists |
| `references/kit.md` | The building blocks: engine, cast, sets, room kit, light, UI, looks, and how to add each |
| `references/sound.md` | Writing sound events, prompts, levels, costs |
| `references/traps.md` | Everything that cost time on the two example episodes |
| `studio/` | The Remotion project: copy it once, then every episode lives in it |
| `scripts/` | voice, plan, stills, board, sfx, mixcheck, motiongrid, master (Python 3.9+ and Node) |

## Rules

- **Original characters only.** Pip (the hero, look B) and Mo (his friend) are ours, and so are the sister, mum and
  the suit on the rig. Never a channel's own hero, and nothing that resembles a famous cartoon character: check every
  new look on the cast sheet (Mo's first hat was dropped for drifting toward one).
- **Original stories.** The formula is shared; the episode isn't anyone else's. Don't remake a channel's title.
- **Never claim the viral channels are made with Claude** or any other tool. Nobody has said how they're made.
- **Keys by name only.** `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, from the environment or a `.env`
  above the studio. Never print, paste or hardcode a key.
- **Report the ElevenLabs credits** of every run: the scripts log them to `out/<slug>/costs.json` and `master.py`
  totals them in `report.json`. The voice's cost is read from the account's history (exact); sound clips don't show
  there, so their cost comes from the account counter, which can lag: re-read it before you report. Say the number
  when you hand the episode over. The copy-paste run cost 152 credits (78 for the voice, 74 for 12 new clips).
- **Storyboard before animation.** No video render until the stills pass the self-check (step 5) and, when the person
  is in the loop, they've seen the board.
- **Every fact is real.** A number in the script is worked out and sourced in the episode's `science` field first.

## Setup (once per machine)

Needs Node 18+, ffmpeg and ffprobe on the PATH, Python 3.9+ with `numpy` and `Pillow`, and an ElevenLabs key.

```bash
cp -r <skill>/studio ./what-if-studio && cd what-if-studio && npm install
```

Everything below runs from that studio folder; `<skill>` is this skill's folder. To work offline or in your own
brand face, put a display font in `public/fonts/` and set `titleFont` in `src/studio.config.ts` (the default title
face, Bricolage Grotesque, and the UI faces load from Google Fonts at render time). To update an existing studio to
a newer engine, copy `<skill>/studio/src/engine` over its `src/engine`.

## The pipeline

Work through the steps in order. Each ends on something you look at before the next.

### 1. Audio Intake & Transcription (Recommended)

Drop your voiceover audio (`voice.wav` or `voice.mp3`) and optional plain-text script:

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/transcribe.py <slug> <path-to-audio> [<path-to-script.txt>]
```

This uses local `faster-whisper` (100% offline, $0 cost, unlimited duration up to 10+ minutes) to generate millisecond word timestamps in `src/episodes/<slug>/words.json` and initialize `episode.json`. Alternatively, you can use `voice.py <slug>` for direct ElevenLabs generation.

### 2. Shot List & Timeline Planning

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/plan.py <slug>
```

For long-form episodes (7 to 10 minutes), `plan.py` automatically generates a procedural shot breakdown with varied camera grammar (wides, mediums, close-ups, inserts, and blueprint schematics) using the built-in sets and character rigs (`director.tsx`). It creates `timeline.json`, `shots.tsx`, and `out/<slug>/shotlist.md`.

### 3. Storyboard Stills

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
node <skill>/scripts/stills.mjs <slug>
python <skill>/scripts/board.py <slug>
```

Renders `out/<slug>/storyboard.jpg` (one still per shot for quality check).

### 4. Sound Design & Ambience

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/sfx.py <slug>
```

Loops background music beds, layers continuous room/outdoor ambiences, and inserts transition stingers.

### 5. Master Render (7–10 Minutes Support)

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/master.py <slug> [--concurrency 6]
```

For long-form episodes, `master.py` renders in 1-minute frame segments, checkpoints progress, losslessly stitches chunks via FFmpeg, and masters the final audio mix to EBU R128 (-14.0 LUFS with true peak limiting).

### 5. Self-check the stills

Look at the storyboard, then open every still in `out/<slug>/board/` at full size, and run the storyboard checklist
in `references/look.md` honestly, shot by shot. Write down what fails, fix it, re-render just those shots
(`stills.mjs <slug> S3 S7`), rebuild the sheet and look again. Repeat until it passes. Check `references/traps.md`
for the failure you're seeing before inventing a fix. If the person is in the loop, show them the board now and
take their notes before animating.

### 6. Animate

Bring each shot to life from its key pose: `poseAt` keys with anticipation, holds and overshoot, `faceAt` for
expressions, camera moves with `kf`, the power's look, the `fx`. Then render a draft and check the motion:

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/master.py <slug>
python <skill>/scripts/motiongrid.py <slug> S2 S5
node <skill>/scripts/stills.mjs <slug> --frames 120 240
```

Read the grids like a flipbook against the motion checklist in `references/look.md`; fix and re-render until it
reads.

### 7. Sound

Read `references/sound.md`. Add `sound` to `episode.json`: the clips (prompt and length), one event per visible
action cued to its shot, ambiences per location, the music bed and the levels. Check what the library already has,
then generate:

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/sfx.py <slug> --dry
python <skill>/scripts/sfx.py <slug>
```

It prints the credits it used and sets the stem volumes in `timeline.json`. Then check that every word stays clear:

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/mixcheck.py <slug>
```

It lists the moments, while a word is being spoken, where effects or music come within 3 dB of the voice. A hit that
illustrates a word lands in the pause just after it, never on it; a bed (a hum, a drone) under a key line comes down;
if most of the stem crowds the voice, lower `sfx_lu`. Re-run sfx.py and the check until only deliberate overlaps
remain (a title boom, a turn).

### 8. Master and hand over

```bash
python <skill>/scripts/master.py <slug>
```

Renders, brings the mix to -14 LUFS with peaks under -1 dBTP, and writes `out/<slug>/report.json` (length, loudness,
pace, credits). Watch the final file once through with sound. Hand over `out/<slug>/<slug>-final.mp4` and
`out/<slug>/storyboard.jpg`, with the length, the ElevenLabs credits used, and anything you'd still improve.

## Where an episode lives

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/episodes/<slug>/episode.json` | Everything you write: script, science, shots, edit, fx, sound |
| `src/episodes/<slug>/shots.tsx`, `index.tsx` | The drawing: one component per shot, the power's look |
| `src/episodes/<slug>/words.json`, `timeline.json` | Written by voice.py and plan.py (sfx.py adds the volumes) |
| `public/<slug>/` | voice.wav, sfx.wav, music.wav |
| `out/<slug>/` | board stills, storyboard.jpg, shotlist.md, motion grids, renders, costs.json, report.json |
| `library/sfx/` | Every generated sound clip, shared by all episodes |
